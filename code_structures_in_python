DOUBLE LIST Comprehension 

python
[lic_block["URL"] for lic_list in all_licenses for lic_block in lic_list]

This means:

1.Loop through each lic_list in all_licenses

2.Then loop through each lic_block (a dict) inside that lic_list

3.For each lic_block, extract the value of the "URL" key

So this structure:

text
[
  [a], 
  [], 
  [b, c]
]
...gets flattened to:

text
[a["URL"], b["URL"], c["URL"]]
âœ… In Other Words
It's equivalent to:

python
license_urls = []
for lic_list in all_licenses:
    for lic_block in lic_list:
        license_urls.append(lic_block["URL"])
But the list comprehension version is concise and Pythonic.
